But a refusal rate of 15% suggests employers are struggling to get the application process right. UK immigration rules are demanding on employers who want to bring talent to the UK. However, the ability for UK organisations to access skilled talent from overseas has never been more essential. Our expert UK immigration lawyers will guide you through the process, step-by-step to ensure you submit all the documents, correctly filled, on time.</p>

Whilst it is not possible to appeal against every refusal. Judicial Review is the procedure by which you can seek to challenge the decision, action or failure to act of a public body exercising a public law function. Appeals and reviews of decisions made by the Home Office can be complex and seeking the advice and assistance of an immigration specialist is highly recommended.</p>
